 * CLIENTS refers to the set of clients (by their common-name) which
 * this instance is allowed ('+') to connect to, or is excluded ('-')
 * from connecting to.  Note that in the case of client-to-client
 * connections, such communication must be allowed by the packet filter
 * configuration files of both clients.
 *
 * SUBNETS refers to IP addresses or IP address subnets which this
 * instance may connect to ('+') or is excluded ('-') from connecting
 * to.
 *
 * DROP or ACCEPT defines default policy when there is no explicit match
 * for a common-name or subnet.  The [END] tag must exist.  A special
 * purpose tag called [KILL] will immediately kill the client instance.
 * A given client or subnet rule applies to both incoming and outgoing
 * packets.
 *
 * See plugin/defer/simple.c for an example on using asynchronous
 * authentication and client-specific packet filtering.
