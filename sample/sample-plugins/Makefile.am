# We don't want automake to pull in libtool for building these
# sample-plugins.  Even though this breaks the conceptual ideas
# around autoconf/automake/libtools ... these sample plug-ins
# are just sample code, not to be installed or distributed outside
# of the source tarball.  Not even built by default, by design.
#
# We only add this as a simple and convenient way to build all
# these plug-ins with the same build parameters as the rest
# of the OpenVPN code.
#
# All the plugins which will be built are processed in this
# separate Makefile, which disconnects everything just enough
# to achieve our goal.
