# Usage: ./git-version.py [directory]
# Find a good textual representation of the git commit currently checked out.
# Make that representation available as CONFIGURE_GIT_REVISION in
# <directory>/config-version.h.
# It will prefer a tag name if it is checked out exactly, otherwise will use
# the branch name. 'none' if no branch is checked out (detached HEAD).
# This is used to enhance the output of openvpn --version with Git information.
