/**
 * @defgroup eventloop Main Event Loop module
 *
 * This main event loop module drives the packet processing of OpenVPN.
 *
 * OpenVPN is an event driven system.  Its activities are driven by a main
 * event loop, which repeatedly waits for one of several predefined events
 * to occur, and then calls the appropriate module to handle the event.
 * The major types of network events that OpenVPN processes are:
 * - A packet can be read from the external network interface.
 *   - The main event loop activates the \link external_multiplexer
 *     External Multiplexer\endlink to read and process the packet.
 * - A packet can be read from the virtual tun/tap network interface.
 *   - The main event loop activates the \link internal_multiplexer
 *     Internal Multiplexer\endlink to read and process the packet.
 * - If a packet is ready to be sent out as a VPN tunnel packet: the
 *   external network interface can be written to.
 *   - The main event loop activates the \link external_multiplexer
 *     External Multiplexer\endlink to send the packet.
 * - If a packet is ready to be sent to a locally reachable destination:
 *   the virtual tun/tap network interface can be written to.
 *   - The main event loop activates the \link internal_multiplexer
 *     Internal Multiplexer\endlink to send the packet.
 *
 * Beside these external events, OpenVPN also processes other types of
 * internal events.  These include scheduled events, such as resending of
 * non-acknowledged control channel messages.
 *
 * @par Main event loop implementations
 *
 * Depending on the mode in which OpenVPN is running, a different main
 * event loop function is called to drive the event processing.  The
 * following implementations are available:
 * - Client mode using UDP or TCP: \c tunnel_point_to_point()
 * - Server mode using UDP: \c tunnel_server_udp()
 * - Server mode using TCP: \c tunnel_server_tcp()
