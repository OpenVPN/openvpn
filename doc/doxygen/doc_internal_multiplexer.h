/**
 * @addtogroup internal_multiplexer Internal Multiplexer module
 *
 * The Internal Multiplexer is the link between the virtual tun/tap
 * network interface and the \link data_control Data Channel Control
 * module\endlink.  It reads packets from the virtual network interface,
 * determines for which remote OpenVPN peer they are destined, and then
 * passes the packets on to the Data Channel Control module together with
 * information about their destination VPN tunnel instance.
 *
 * This module also handles packets traveling in the reverse direction,
 * which have already been processed by the Data Channel Control module
 * and are destined for a locally reachable host.
