/**
 * @defgroup data_control Data Channel Control module
 *
 * This module controls the processing of packets as they pass through the
 * data channel.
 *
 * The Data Channel Control module controls the processing of packets as
 * they pass through the data channel.  The processing includes packet
 * compression, fragmentation, and the performing of security operations
 * on the packets.  This module does not do the processing itself, but
 * passes the packet to other data channel modules to perform the
 * appropriate actions.
 *
 * Packets can travel in two directions through the data channel.  They
 * can be going to a remote destination which is reachable through a VPN
 * tunnel, in which case this module prepares them to be sent out through
 * a VPN tunnel.  On the other hand, they can have been received through a
 * VPN tunnel from a remote OpenVPN peer, in which case this module
 * retrieves the packet in its original form as it was before entering the
 * VPN tunnel on the remote OpenVPN peer.  How this module processes
 * packets traveling in the two directions is discussed in more detail
 * below.
 *
 * @par Packets to be sent to a remote OpenVPN peer
 * This module's main function for processing packets traveling in this
 * direction is \c encrypt_sign(), which performs the following processing
 * steps:
 * - Call the \link compression Data Channel Compression module\endlink to
 *   perform packet compression if necessary.
 * - Call the \link fragmentation Data Channel Fragmentation
 *   module\endlink to perform packet fragmentation if necessary.
 * - Call the \link data_crypto Data Channel Crypto module\endlink to
 *   perform the required security operations.
 *
 * @par
 * See the \c encrypt_sign() documentation for details of these
 * interactions.
 *
 * @par
 * After the above processing is complete, the packet is ready to be sent
 * to a remote OpenVPN peer as a VPN tunnel packet.  The actual sending of
 * the packet is handled by the \link external_multiplexer External
 * Multiplexer\endlink.
 *
 * @par Packets received from a remote OpenVPN peer
 * The function that controls how packets traveling in this direction are
 * processed is \c process_incoming_link().  That function, however, also
 * performs some of the tasks required for the \link external_multiplexer
 * External Multiplexer\endlink and is therefore listed as part of that
 * module, instead of here.
 *
 * @par
 * After the \c process_incoming_link() function has determined that a
 * received packet is a data channel packet, it performs the following
 * processing steps:
 * - Call the \link data_crypto Data Channel Crypto module\endlink to
 *   perform the required security operations.
 * - Call the \link fragmentation Data Channel Fragmentation
 *   module\endlink to perform packet reassembly if necessary.
 * - Call the \link compression Data Channel Compression module\endlink to
 *   perform packet decompression if necessary.
 *
 * @par
 * See the \c process_incoming_link() documentation for details of these
 * interactions.
 *
 * @par
 * After the above processing is complete, the packet is in its original
 * form again as it was received by the remote OpenVPN peer.  It can now
 * be routed further to its final destination.  If that destination is a
 * locally reachable host, then the \link internal_multiplexer Internal
 * Multiplexer\endlink will send it there.
