/**
 * @addtogroup external_multiplexer External Multiplexer module
 *
 * The External Multiplexer is the link between the external network
 * interface and the other OpenVPN modules.  It reads packets from the
 * external network interface, determines which remote OpenVPN peer and
 * VPN tunnel they are associated with, and whether they are data channel
 * or control channel packets.  It then passes the packets on to the
 * appropriate processing module.
 *
 * This module also handles packets traveling in the reverse direction,
 * which have been generated by the local control channel or which have
 * already been processed by the \link data_control Data Channel Control
 * module\endlink and are destined for a remote host reachable through a
 * VPN tunnel.
