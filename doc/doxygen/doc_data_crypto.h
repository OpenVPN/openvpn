/**
 * @addtogroup data_crypto Data Channel Crypto module
 *
 * The Data Channel Crypto Module performs cryptographic operations on
 * data channel packets.
 *
 * @par Security parameters
 * This module is merely the user of a VPN tunnel's security parameters.
 * It does not perform the negotiation and setup of the security
 * parameters, nor the %key generation involved.  These actions are done
 * by the \link control_processor Control Channel Processor\endlink.  This
 * module receives the appropriate security parameters from that module in
 * the form of a \c crypto_options structure when they are necessary for
 * processing a packet.
 *
 * @par Packet processing functions
 * This module receives data channel packets from the \link data_control
 * Data Channel Control module\endlink and processes them according to the
 * security parameters of the packet's VPN tunnel.  The \link data_control
 * Data Channel Control module\endlink uses the following interface
 * functions:
 *  - For packets which will be sent to a remote OpenVPN peer:
 *     - \c tls_pre_encrypt()
 *     - \c openvpn_encrypt()
 *     - \c tls_post_encrypt()
 *  - For packets which have been received from a remote OpenVPN peer:
 *     - \c tls_pre_decrypt() (documented as part of the \link
 *       external_multiplexer External Multiplexer\endlink)
 *     - \c openvpn_decrypt()
 *
 * @par Settings that control this module's activity
 * How the data channel processes packets received from the \link data_control
 * Data Channel Control module\endlink at runtime depends on the associated
 * \c crypto_options structure.  To perform cryptographic operations, the
 * \c crypto_options.key_ctx_bi must contain the correct cipher and HMAC
 * security parameters for the direction the packet is traveling in.
 *
 * @par Crypto algorithms
 * This module uses the crypto algorithm implementations of the external
 * crypto library (currently either OpenSSL (default), or mbed TLS).
