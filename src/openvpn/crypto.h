 *
 * @par Crypto packet formats
 * The Data Channel Crypto module supports a number of crypto modes and
 * configurable options. The actual packet format depends on these options. A
 * Data Channel packet can consist of:
 *  - \b Opcode, one byte specifying the packet type (see @ref network_protocol
 *    "Network protocol").
 *  - \b Peer-id, if using the v2 data channel packet format (see @ref
 *    network_protocol "Network protocol").
 *  - \b HMAC, covering the ciphertext IV + ciphertext. The HMAC size depends
 *    on the \c \-\-auth option. If \c \-\-auth \c none is specified, there is no
 *    HMAC at all.
 *  - \b Ciphertext \b IV. The IV size depends on the \c \-\-cipher option.
 *  - \b Packet \b ID, a 32-bit incrementing packet counter that provides replay
 *    protection.
 *  - \b Timestamp, a 32-bit timestamp of the current time.
 *  - \b Payload, the plain text network packet to be encrypted (unless
 *    encryption is disabled by using \c \-\-cipher \c none). The payload might
 *    already be compressed (see @ref compression "Compression module").
 *
 * @par
 * This section does not discuss the opcode and peer-id, since those do not
 * depend on the data channel crypto. See @ref network_protocol
 * "Network protocol" for more information on those.
 *
 * @par
 * \e Legenda \n
 * <tt>[ xxx ]</tt> = unprotected \n
 * <tt>[ - xxx - ]</tt> = authenticated \n
 * <tt>[ * xxx * ]</tt> = encrypted and authenticated
 *
 * @par
 * <b>CBC data channel cypto format</b> \n
 * In CBC mode, both TLS-mode and static key mode are supported. The IV
 * consists of random bits to provide unpredictable IVs. \n
 * <i>CBC IV format:</i> \n
 * <tt> [ - random - ] </tt> \n
 * <i>CBC data channel crypto format in TLS-mode:</i> \n
 * <tt> [ HMAC ] [ - IV - ] [ * packet ID * ] [ * packet payload * ] </tt> \n
 * <i>CBC data channel crypto format in static key mode:</i> \n
 * <tt> [ HMAC ] [ - IV - ] [ * packet ID * ] [ * timestamp * ]
 * [ * packet payload * ] </tt>
 *
 * @par
 * <b>CFB/OFB data channel crypto format</b> \n
 * CFB and OFB modes are only supported in TLS mode. In these modes, the IV
 * consists of the packet counter and a timestamp. If the IV is more than 8
 * bytes long, the remaining space is filled with zeroes. The packet counter may
 * not roll over within a single TLS sessions. This results in a unique IV for
 * each packet, as required by the CFB and OFB cipher modes.
 *
 * @par
 * <i>CFB/OFB IV format:</i> \n
 * <tt>   [ - packet ID - ] [ - timestamp - ] [ - opt: zero-padding - ] </tt>\n
 * <i>CFB/OFB data channel crypto format:</i> \n
 * <tt>   [ HMAC ] [ - IV - ] [ * packet payload * ] </tt>
 *
 * @par
 * <b>GCM data channel crypto format</b> \n
 * GCM modes are only supported in TLS mode.  In these modes, the IV consists of
 * the 32-bit packet counter followed by data from the HMAC key.  The HMAC key
 * can be used as IV, since in GCM and CCM modes the HMAC key is not used for
 * the HMAC.  The packet counter may not roll over within a single TLS sessions.
 * This results in a unique IV for each packet, as required by GCM.
 *
 * @par
 * The HMAC key data is pre-shared during the connection setup, and thus can be
 * omitted in on-the-wire packets, saving 8 bytes per packet (for GCM and CCM).
 *
 * @par
 * In GCM mode, P_DATA_V2 headers (the opcode and peer-id) are also
 * authenticated as Additional Data.
 *
 * @par
 * <i>GCM IV format:</i> \n
 * <tt>   [ - packet ID - ] [ - HMAC key data - ] </tt>\n
 * <i>P_DATA_V1 GCM data channel crypto format:</i> \n
 * <tt>   [ opcode ] [ - packet ID - ] [ TAG ] [ * packet payload * ] </tt>
 * <i>P_DATA_V2 GCM data channel crypto format:</i> \n
 * <tt>   [ - opcode/peer-id - ] [ - packet ID - ] [ TAG ] [ * packet payload * ] </tt>
 *
 * @par
 * <b>No-crypto data channel format</b> \n
 * In no-crypto mode (\c \-\-cipher \c none is specified), both TLS-mode and
 * static key mode are supported. No encryption will be performed on the packet,
 * but packets can still be authenticated. This mode does not require an IV.\n
 * <i>No-crypto data channel crypto format in TLS-mode:</i> \n
 * <tt> [ HMAC ] [ - packet ID - ] [ - packet payload - ] </tt> \n
 * <i>No-crypto data channel crypto format in static key mode:</i> \n
 * <tt> [ HMAC ] [ - packet ID - ] [ - timestamp - ] [ - packet payload - ] </tt>
