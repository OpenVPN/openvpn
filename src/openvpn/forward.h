 * general structure is as follows:
 * - Check that the client authentication has succeeded; if not, drop the
 *   packet.
 * - If the \a comp_frag argument is true:
 *   - Call \c lzo_compress() of the \link Data Channel Compression
 *     module\endlink to (possibly) compress the packet.
 *   - Call \c fragment_outgoing() of the \link Data Channel Fragmentation
 *     module\endlink to (possibly) fragment the packet.
 * - Activate the \link Data Channel Crypto module\endlink to perform
 *   security operations on the packet.
 *   - Call \c tls_pre_encrypt() to choose the appropriate security
 *     parameters for this packet.
 *   - Call \c openvpn_encrypt() to encrypt and HMAC signed the packet.
 *   - Call \c tls_post_encrypt() to prepend the one-byte OpenVPN header
 *     and do some TLS accounting.
 * - Place the resulting packet in \c c->c2.to_link so that it can be sent
 *   over the external network interface to its remote destination by the
 *   \link external_multiplexer External Multiplexer\endlink.
 *
 * @param c - The context structure of the VPN tunnel associated with this
 *     packet.
 * @param comp_frag - Whether to do packet compression and fragmentation.
 *     This flag is set to true the first time a packet is processed.  If
 *     the packet then gets fragmented, this function will be called again
 *     once for each remaining fragment with this parameter set to false.
