/**
 * @brief Checks the formatting and validity of options inside push-update messages.
 *
 * This function is used to validate and process options
 * in push-update messages. It performs the following checks:
 * - Determines if the options are updatable.
 * - Checks for the presence of the `-` flag, which indicates that the option
 *   should be removed.
 * - Checks for the `?` flag, which marks the option as optional and suppresses
 *   errors if the client cannot update it.
 * - Increase the value pointed by 'i' when we encounter the `'-'` and `'?'` flags
 *   after validating them and updating the appropriate flags in the `flags` variable.
 * - `-?option`, `-option`, `?option` are valid formats, `?-option` is not a valid format.
 * - If the flags and the option are not consecutive, the option is invalid:
 *   `- ?option`, `-? option`, `- option` are invalid formats.
 *
 * @param line A pointer to an option string. This string is the option being validated.
 * @param i A pointer to an integer that represents the current index in the `line` string.
 * @param flags A pointer where flags will be stored:
 *              - `PUSH_OPT_TO_REMOVE`: Set if the `-` flag is present.
 *              - `PUSH_OPT_OPTIONAL`: Set if the `?` flag is present.
 *
 * @return true if the flags and option combination are valid.
 * @return false if:
 *         - The `-` and `?` flags are not formatted correctly.
 *         - The `line` parameter is empty or `NULL`.
 *         - The `?` flag is absent and the option is not updatable.
