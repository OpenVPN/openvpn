/**
 * @brief Handles the receiving of a push-update message and applies updates to the specified options.
 *
 * This function processes a push-update message, validating its content and applying updates
 * to the options specified in the message. It also handles split messages if the complete
 * message has not yet been received.
 *
 * @param c The context for the operation.
 * @param permission_mask The permission mask specifying which options are allowed to be pulled.
 * @param option_types_found A pointer to a variable that will be filled with the types of options
 *                           found in the message.
 * @param buf A buffer containing the received message.
 *
 * @return
 * - `PUSH_MSG_UPDATE`: The message was processed successfully, and the updates were applied.
 * - `PUSH_MSG_CONTINUATION`: The message is a fragment of a larger message, and the program is
 *                            waiting for the final part.
 * - `PUSH_MSG_ERROR`: An error occurred during message processing, or the message is invalid.
