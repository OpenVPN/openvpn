/**
 * Verify that the remote OpenVPN peer's certificate allows setting up a
 * VPN tunnel.
 * @ingroup control_tls
 *
 * This callback function is called every time a new TLS session is being
 * setup to determine whether the remote OpenVPN peer's certificate is
 * allowed to connect. It is called for once for every certificate in the chain.
 * The callback functionality is configured in the \c init_ssl() function, which
 * calls the OpenSSL library's \c SSL_CTX_set_verify() function with \c
 * verify_callback() as its callback argument.
 *
 * It checks preverify_ok, and registers the certificate hash. If these steps
 * succeed, it calls the \c verify_cert() function, which performs
 * OpenVPN-specific verification.
 *
 * @param preverify_ok - Whether the remote OpenVPN peer's certificate
 *                       past verification.  A value of 1 means it
 *                       verified successfully, 0 means it failed.
 * @param ctx          - The complete context used by the OpenSSL library
 *                       to verify the certificate chain.
 *
 * @return The return value indicates whether the supplied certificate is
 *     allowed to set up a VPN tunnel.  The following values can be
 *     returned:
 *      - \c 0: failure, this certificate is not allowed to connect.
 *      - \c 1: success, this certificate is allowed to connect.
