 * Valgrind is a great tool for debugging memory issues,
 * though it seems to generate a lot of warnings in OpenSSL
 * about uninitialized data. To silence these warnings,
 * I've put together a suppressions file
 * in debug/valgrind-suppress.
 *
 * Also, grep for VALGRIND_MAKE_READABLE in the OpenVPN source.
 * Because valgrind thinks that some of the data passed from
 * OpenSSL back to OpenVPN is tainted due to being sourced
 * from uninitialized data, we need to untaint it before use --
 * otherwise we will get a lot of useless warnings.

 *
 * When dmalloc is installed and enabled,

 *
 *    dmalloc -l dlog -i 100 low -p log-unknown
 *
 * Also, put this in your .bashrc file:

 *
 *    export DMALLOC_OPTIONS="debug=0x4e48503,inter=100,log=dlog"
 *
 *  NOTE: When building dmalloc you need to add something
 *  like this to dmalloc's settings.h -- it will allocate a static
 *  buffer to be used as the malloc arena:
 *
 *  #define INTERNAL_MEMORY_SPACE (1024 * 1024 * 50)
