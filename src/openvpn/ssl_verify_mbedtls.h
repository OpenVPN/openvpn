/**
 * Verify that the remote OpenVPN peer's certificate allows setting up a

 * @ingroup control_tls
 *
 * This callback function is called when a new TLS session is being setup to
 * determine whether the remote OpenVPN peer's certificate is allowed to
 * connect. It is called for once for every certificate in the chain. The
 * callback functionality is configured in the \c key_state_ssl_init() function,
 * which calls the mbed TLS library's \c mbedtls_ssl_conf_verify() function with
 * \c verify_callback() as its callback argument.
 *
 * It checks *flags and registers the certificate hash. If these steps succeed,
 * it calls the \c verify_cert() function, which performs OpenVPN-specific
 * verification.
 *
 * @param session_obj  - The OpenVPN \c tls_session associated with this object,
 *                       as set during SSL session setup.
 * @param cert         - The certificate used by mbed TLS.
 * @param cert_depth   - The depth of the current certificate in the chain, with
 *                       0 being the actual certificate.
 * @param flags        - Whether the remote OpenVPN peer's certificate
 *                       passed verification.  A value of 0 means it
 *                       verified successfully, any other value means it
 *                       failed. \c verify_callback() is considered to have
 *                       ok'ed this certificate if flags is 0 when it returns.
 *
 * @return The return value is 0 unless a fatal error occurred.
