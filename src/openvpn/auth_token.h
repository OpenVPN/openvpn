/**
 * Generate an auth token based on username and timestamp
 *
 * The idea of auth token is to be stateless, so that we can verify use it
 * even after we have forgotten about it or server has been restarted.
 *
 * To achieve this even though we cannot trust the client we use HMAC
 * to be able to verify the information.
 *
 * Format of the auth-token (before base64 encode)
 *
 * session id(12 bytes)|uint64 timestamp (8 bytes)|
 * uint64 timestamp (8 bytes)|sha256-hmac(32 bytes)
 *
 * The first timestamp is the time the token was initially created and is used to
 * determine the maximum renewable time of the token. We always include this even
 * if tokens do not expire (this value is not used) to keep the code cleaner.
 *
 * The second timestamp is the time the token was renewed/regenerated and is used
 * to determine if this token has been renewed in the acceptable time range
 * (2 * renegotiation timeout)
 *
 * The session id is a random string of 12 byte (or 16 in base64) that is not
 * used by OpenVPN itself but kept intact so that external logging/management
 * can track the session multiple reconnects/servers. It is deliberately chosen
 * be a multiple of 3 bytes to have a base64 encoding without padding.
 *
 * The hmac is calculated over the username concatenated with the
 * raw auth-token bytes to include authentication of the username in the token
 *
 * We encode the auth-token with base64 and then prepend "SESS_ID_" before
 * sending it to the client.
 *
 * This function will free() an existing multi->auth_token and keep the
 * existing initial timestamp and session id contained in that token.
