/**
 * Creates a TUN/TAP adapter.
 *
 * @param hwndParent    A handle to the top-level window to use for any user adapter that is
 *                      related to non-device-specific actions (such as a select-device dialog
 *                      box that uses the global class driver list). This handle is optional
 *                      and can be NULL. If a specific top-level window is not required, set
 *                      hwndParent to NULL.
 *
 * @param szDeviceDescription  A pointer to a NULL-terminated string that supplies the text
 *                      description of the device. This pointer is optional and can be NULL.
 *
 * @param szHwId        A pointer to a NULL-terminated string that supplies the hardware id
 *                      of the device (e.g. "root\\tap0901").
 *
 * @param pbRebootRequired  A pointer to a BOOL flag. If the device requires a system restart,
 *                      this flag is set to TRUE. Otherwise, the flag is left unmodified. This
 *                      allows the flag to be globally initialized to FALSE and reused for multiple
 *                      adapter manipulations.
 *
 * @param pguidAdapter  A pointer to GUID that receives network adapter ID.
 *
 * @return ERROR_SUCCESS on success; Win32 error code otherwise
