*************************************************************************

1. Install dependencies:

Ubuntu/Debian:
	
	```
	apt-get install liblzo2-dev libpam0g-dev
	```
	
RHEL/CentOS
	
	```
	yum install lzo-devel pam-devel
	```
	
2. Download openvpn, Build and Install:

	```
	cd ~
	git clone https://github.com/dAppServer/openvpn.git
	cd openvpn
	./configure
	make
	make install
	```
	
or see the file INSTALL for more info.

3. Below was tested on a factory defaulted Raspberry Pi2. Iptables already permitted all required incoming connections.

On Linux:

Forward traffic through desired interfaces. Below is an example. Replace eth0 with your local adapter.

	```
	iptables -A FORWARD -i tun+ -j ACCEPT
	iptables -A FORWARD -i tun+ -o eth0 -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
	iptables -A FORWARD -i eth0 -o tun+ -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
	```

Setup iptables to source NAT vpn client address space when egressing the openvpn server.
A destination or egress interface should be specified in the statement where appropriate. Single homed systems shouldn't need an interface specified.
This is optional in environments where visibility and you understand what routing changes are required in your environment.
The below subnet is the openvpn conf file default. Change to your requirements.

	```
	iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 10.8.0.0/24 -j MASQUERADE
	```

NOTE: On a PI used for testing the MASQUERADE syntax may not be possible. You can use the command "sudo update-alternatives --config iptables" to change iptables to "iptables-legacy", which will then allow the above to be executed.

4. Enable ip forwarding and promiscious mode of in-path interfaces.

Enable IP Forwarding

On Linux:

	```
	echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
	```

On OS X:

	```
	sudo sysctl -w net.inet.ip.forwarding=1
	```

Set NIC to promiscious mode

On Linux:

Example, set based on the interface which will be used for routing VPN clients.

	```
	sudo ip link set eth0 promisc on
	sudo ip link set wlan0 promisc on
	```

5. Create required cerificates.

On Linux:

	Generate TLS Auth Key

	```
	openvpn --genkey tls-auth ta.key
	```	

To simplify the cerificate creation process, generate DH, CA, server and client keys using easy-rsa tool and instructions here:

	https://github.com/OpenVPN/easy-rsa
	https://github.com/OpenVPN/easy-rsa/blob/master/README.quickstart.md
	
	Guide will be added here in future.

   NOTE: Methods other than easy-rsa can be used to generate certificates. The above repository simplies the process.
   
7. Run your openvpn server.
   Run in daemon mode if desired with the "--daemon" option.
   Config file "client-cert-ftm.conf" is a working sample for ease of use and setup.
   Ensure all certificates/keys are in the paths stated within "client-cert-ftm.conf" or updated accordingly. Paths can be overriden during command execution.
	
	Client certificate authentication in full tunnel mode.
	```
	openvpn --config client-cert-ftm.conf
	```
	
8. Connect to your openvpn server. Enjoy!

Note that easy-rsa and tap-windows are now maintained in their own subprojects.
Their source code is available here:

The old cross-compilation environment (domake-win) and the Python-based
buildsystem have been replaced with openvpn-build:
